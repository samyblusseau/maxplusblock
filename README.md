Train, prune and test a morphological neural network.
This is a companion code to the paper "Max-plus Operators Applied to Filter Selection and Model Pruning in Neural Networks" by Yunxiang Zhang, Samy Blusseau, Santiago Velasco-Forero, Isabelle Bloch and Jes√∫s Angulo,
published in the International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology and Its Applications to Signal and Image Processing (ISMM) 2019.

Provided Tensorflow and Keras are installed, the code should be run by the command

python testMaxPlus.py

and needs the file maxPlusDense.py to work.
The script testMaxPlus.py defines a morphological neural network composed of an input layer, a linear layer and a max-plus (or dilation layer), trians it on the Mnist or fashion-mnist dataset, then removes the unused filters from the linear layer and finally tests the reduced network on the test set.
